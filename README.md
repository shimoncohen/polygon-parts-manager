# Migrations

Building the migrations docker file
```bash
docker build -t pp-migration:v<tag> -f migrations.Dockerfile .
```

Running the migration docker locally 
```bash
docker run -it --rm -e NODE_ENV=<env> --network host -v ./config/<env>.json:/usr/app/config/<env>.json pp-migration:<tag>
```
Note: in this command we are mounting local config file to the container instead of adding -e to all environment variables .

In the following example a production.json file is provided. The `<env>` is set to production. like so:
```
docker run -it --rm -e NODE_ENV=production --network host -v /path/to/production.json:/usr/app/config/production.json pp-migration:v1.0.1
```
production.json:
```json
{
  "db": {
    "type": "postgres",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 5432,
    "username": "postgres",
    "password": "password",
    "enableSslAuth": false      //Note: when ssl is enabled , ssl keys could be mounted the same way as config
    "sslPaths": {  //Note: this should hold the paths to the keys inside the mounted folder
      "ca": "",  
      "key": "",
      "cert": ""
    },
    "database": "test_migrations",
    "schema": "polygon_parts",
    "synchronize": false,
    "logging": "all",    //available values: false , true, "all"
